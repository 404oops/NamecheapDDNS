# NamecheapDDNS
A macOS Sonoma (meaning you can only run this on Sonoma) application made for updating your Namecheap A+ (DDNS) records. Uses official Namecheap API. Written using nothing but pure, no-dependency Swift, just like Tim Apple intended it.

Downloads are available at the Releases tab. If you're paranoid about malware, feel free to look at the source code (and build it yourself). It shouldn't be too complicated to understand for simple people.
### Made with love by Nate. Many thanks to Jake, Kota, Rosie and Andrew.
# How do I build this?:
You need:
- macOS Sonoma
- Xcode 15
- A functioning brain (well not really)
# How do I contribute?
The workflow is simple:
1. Implement your feature in full. If you're stuck on something, take your time and progress slowly. No one likes a rusher
2. Make a pull request outlining every single thing you implemented. I don't need comments to understand code as simple as Swift allows it to be, but feel free to add some if you wrote code not even you'd understand in the future.
3. I'll see what you did and will see if you added it without any issues.
